# Pydata Visualization Landscape Tutorial

Welcome to the tutorial! Here we will go through 4 of the most common visualization libraries and discuss some pros and cons of them. We will be covering Altair, Plotly, Bokeh and Matplotlib.

If you wish to follow along, you will need to have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python
in order to use the `conda` package manager. I recommend Miniconda found [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). In order to run the plotly examples, you will also need nodejs installed, which you can either get from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or install via conda.

With conda installed, you can run the following in the terminal:
`git clone git@github.com:andersbogsnes/viz_landscape.git`
`cd viz_landscape`
`conda create`

In order to use the Plotly rendering in Jupyterlab, check [these](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#jupyterlab-support-python-35) instructions.

With everything setup, run `jupyter lab` and you should be all set!
